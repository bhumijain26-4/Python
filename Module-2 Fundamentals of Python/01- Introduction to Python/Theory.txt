1. Introduction to Python and its Features (simple, high-level, interpreted language).
-> Python is high-level interpreted programming language known for its simplicity.
-> It was created by Guido Van Rossum and first released in 1991.
-> It is the most popular programming language.
-> It has large number of built-in libraries.
-> It is platform independent,meaning that can run on various operating systems.

    
2. History and evolution of Python.
-> Python is a high-level interpreted programming language which was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.

-> Guido named the language "Python" because he was inspired by the tv show Monthy Python and wanted to give the name short and sweet which was quite unique also.
-> So this is the History and evolution of Python.


3. Advantages of using Python over other programming languages.
-> It is easy to learn and use.
-> It is platform independent.
-> It is versatile which can be used for web development,game development,AI and ML.
