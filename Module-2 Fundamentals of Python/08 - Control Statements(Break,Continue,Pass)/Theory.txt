Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops

Break statement :
Break statement is used to terminate the loop after meeting with the condition.

Continue statement :
Continue statement is used to skip the current iteration which is true and continue the loop till its end.

Pass statement :
Pass statement is placeholder.It does nothing but when we don't have any statement to write inside the condition we use this so that the statement can be implemented later.
